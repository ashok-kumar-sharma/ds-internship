# FAKE NEWS DETECTION PROJECT
The authenticity of Information has become a longstanding issue affecting businesses and society, both for printed and digital media. On social networks, the reach and effects of information spread occur at such a fast pace and so amplified that distorted, inaccurate, or false information acquires a tremendous potential to cause real-world impacts, within minutes, for millions of users. Recently, several public concerns about this problem and some approaches to mitigate the problem were expressed. This project is intended to build a model which can predict whether the news is fake or not.
